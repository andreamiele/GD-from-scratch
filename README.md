# GD-from-scratch
Implementation from scratch of the gradient descent algorithm.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In 2021, I tried to better understand the gradient descent algorithm. Therefore I've tried to implement it from scratch for simple problems: linear regression, objective function and paraboloid.


I've implemented for linear regression:
* Classic GD
* SGD
* Mini-batch SGD

I've implemented for objective function:
* Classic GD

I've implemented for paraboloid:
* Classic GD
